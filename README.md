# Task 4: Logistic Regression - Breast Cancer Classification

## Objective
Build a binary classification model using Logistic Regression to detect whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on features in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)
- **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
- **Target Variable:** `diagnosis` (`M` = malignant, `B` = benign)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Workflow
1. **Data Loading** ‚Äì Read the dataset using Pandas
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** ‚Äì Data types, missing values, class distribution
3. **Preprocessing** ‚Äì Dropped unnecessary columns and converted target to numeric
4. **Train-Test Split** ‚Äì 80% train, 20% test
5. **Model Training** ‚Äì Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn
6. **Evaluation** ‚Äì Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
7. **ROC Curve & AUC** ‚Äì Visualized model performance on classification thresholds

## Results
- Achieved high accuracy in classifying tumors
- Visualized model with ROC curve and AUC score
- Interpretation supported by classification report and confusion matrix
